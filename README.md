# Liver and Tumor segmentation

This repo includes my code to train and evaluate a simple Unet on the publicly available dataset of *LiTS - Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge*. This version is extracted from this [page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/liver-tumor-segmentation).

This network will serve as a baseline for helping radiologist to segment the liver and liver tumors (HCC,iCCA and HCC+CCA) in CT scans of a private dataset in order to caracterize hybrid primary liver tumors.
